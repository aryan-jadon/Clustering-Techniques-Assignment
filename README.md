Types of clustering algorithms

Not all clustering algorithms are created equal. 
Different clustering algorithms implement different ideas on how to best cluster your data. 
There are 4 main categories:
1. Centroid-based — uses Euclidean distance to assign every point to the nearest cluster center. Example: K-Means
2. Connectivity-based — assumes that nearby objects (data points) are more related than far away objects. Example: Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC).
3. Density-based — defines clusters as dense regions of space separated by low-density regions. They are good at finding arbitrarily shaped clusters. Example: Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN).
4. Distribution-based — assumes the existence of a specified number of distributions within the data. Each distribution with its own mean (μ) and variance (σ²) / covariance (Cov). Example: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
